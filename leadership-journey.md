#Leadership Journey Essay

##About Me

	My name is Arghya. I’m earning my B.A. in Geography Data Science, with minors in Informatics and Applied Math. I work part time as a Classical Indian Dance Instructor for the Anga Kala Kathak Academy, where I’ve been learning Kathak for the last ten years, and also volunteer for the Academy's two sister organizations. I also lead two student organizations that I love very dearly: Plenum Undergraduate Journal for Geography Research and GeoDat Society for Geography Data Science.


#My Story

##Plenum, Equity Research, and the birth of GeoDat

	Plenum’s fundamental purpose is to connect undergraduate researchers with the broader professional field of Geography. Undergraduate research is transformative. We give students a platform to share independent research projects from their classes with a wider audience and find their place in the field of Geography. 

	Serving as Plenum’s Co-Editor in Chief encouraged me to reflect on how my research has transformed my undergraduate career. My research as an undergraduate geographer has brought spatial equity and environmental justice to the forefront of my academic focus. However, my individual projects were limited by the scope of my individual perspective and life experience. Equity research should itself be equitable. To be truly meaningful, it should involve people of diverse backgrounds and academic disciplines.

	This realization inspired GeoDat. Through GeoDat, I am committed to inviting students of all disciplines into the Geography community to engage in spatial equity research. For our first project, I’ve recruited a diverse team of students to research environmental health disparity in Native Hawaiian & Pacific Islander communities on the West Coast. I reached out to several data science professionals on LinkedIn for advice on the project and was able to get in touch with the Chief Data Officer at the U.S. Census Bureau, whose input has proved very valuable to our project.

##Finding Opportunity in Ambiguity

	Connecting with geography data science professionals through LinkedIn has showed the potential of online networking. Since then, I have continued using GeoDat’s research to spark conversations with professional geography data scientists, so that I can develop a professional network for GeoDat itself and ultimately leverage it to create opportunities for UW students.

	Along with promoting equity research, I will use GeoDat to increase opportunities for technical Geography students. There is a lack of exposure to Geography among students and professional in the tech industry. As a result, Geography students face unnecessary obstacles to finding career opportunities in tech. In addition to proving ourselves, we often have to educate employers about the value of Geography. I want to use GeoDat to show the tech industry who we are on a larger scale, so that individual students won’t have to face this obstacle on their own.

	Just as Plenum helps students find their place in Geography, I hope that GeoDat will help Geography students find their place in tech. Before I graduate in spring 2022, I will direct GeoDat in hosting research projects and quarterly events: career-development webinars in the fall and winter and a hackathon in the spring. For each event, I’ll invite industry professionals and recruiters from GeoDat’s professional network to speak with students. I’ll also use these events as opportunities to highlight notable GeoDat research, thus exposing both audiences—student attendees and industry representatives—to the values of Geography Data Science. By the time I graduate, I aim to leave behind a sustainable process for helping GeoDat reach these goals every year.

##Connecting Kathak and Geography

	My inspiration for leading Plenum and founding GeoDat is my dance teacher, Srimati Antara Datta. In the decade since I joined the Anga Kala Kathak Academy, she has developed two new Academy centers across the U.S. and found two unique nonprofit organizations: Arts Without Borders (AWB), dedicated to connecting people through different art forms, and the Anga Kala Dance Company (AKDC), which provides Academy students with professional training and performance opportunities. In doing so, she has fundamentally expanded the reach of Kathak in the U.S. I want to do the same for my field. I want to bring Geography into the tech industry’s mainstream.

	As a senior student in the Academy, I’ve had the opportunity to take on leadership roles in all three organizations: as an instructor in the Academy, Project Manager in AKDC, and Board Treasurer in AWB. My experiences from these roles have increased my capacity for leadership and catalyzed my journey as a more compassionate and effective leader.

##Leadership Growth through the Arts

	As an Academy instructor, I learned servant leadership. Whether I am preparing students for exams or performances, I never let the stress of deadlines detract from my focus on students’ individual growth as dancers. To help them absorb material, I incorporate games and challenges into their learning. It requires extra time and organization effort, but it is well worth the positive impact on their learning and cohesion as a class. I bring that same attitude to serving the members of GeoDat and Plenum. Although GeoDat’s primary function is research, organizing our events will be equally important. They’ll allow us to reach more tech and Geography students and help bring us all together. This experience has also inspired me to develop a Virtual Study Center for Geography students through Plenum, in order to foster UW’s undergraduate Geography community while campus remains virtual.

	As an AKDC project manager, I learned how to step outside my comfort zone to liaison with representatives from other organizations about the Company’s interests. This experience gave me the confidence to reach out to data science professionals on LinkedIn. I’ve taken a similar direction with Plenum, where I am currently leading efforts to partner with other student organizations and build a network of groups that Plenum can eventually rely on for outreach communications and other needs. As AWB’s treasurer, I became familiar with grant writing and managing finances. These skills will assist me in applying for grants to fund GeoDat’s research and events as well as Plenum’s annual publication.

##Acknowledgements & Future Plans

	I want to thank my departmental advisor, Nell Gross, who has encouraged and believed in me unconditionally since the day I met her. I rely on her advice and optimism for every part of my academic life—my classes, Plenum, GeoDat, scholarships, and applying for the Husky 100. Nell makes the world a better place by being in it and inspires me to do the same. I also want to thank UW’s Academic Support Programs and Disability Resources for Students for giving me the support I needed to be successful as a student, and for teaching me that where there is help there is always hope.

	After I graduate, I am going to pursue a management career in data science. Leading student organizations at UW has given me confidence in my ability to develop, organize, and lead impactful efforts. I want to use my skills to continue working for equity in my career, just as I’m doing now through GeoDat. Someday I’d like to be leading a data science team at an organization like the United Nations or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, where I’ll have a larger influence that I can use to drive positive change on a large-scale.

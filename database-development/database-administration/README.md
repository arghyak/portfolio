# Database Administration Workflow

This folder contains a SQL Script in which I created a normalizd database with constraints, views, functions, stored procedures, permissions, and some sample data. Please refer to the metadata catalog for additional information.

### The script completes the following tasks:

1. Create the database and tables.
2. Create the constrant of each table.
3. Create the base views for each table.
4. Create one reporting view that combines the data for all the tables.
5. Create transactional stored procedures for each table.
6. Set the appropriate permission on the tables, views, and stored procedures for the public role. 
7. Create test code that executes each of the stored procedures and shows the data in the tables.
8. Use the Insert stored procedures to add the data from the spreadsheet into the tables.
